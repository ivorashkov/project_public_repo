Linux commands 
-> ls ( It allows you to list the contents of the directory you want)
-> alias (creating shortcuts of commands)
-> pwd ( command stands for “print working directory,”
		and it outputs the absolute path of the directory you’re in.)
-> cd (It refers to “change directory”)
-> cp ( copy  cp file_to_copy.txt new_file.txt 
		You can also copy entire directories by using the recursive flag:
		cp -r dir_to_copy/ new_copy_dir/)
-> rm (remove files and directories -> rm file_to_copy.txt
		If you want to delete an empty directory, you can use the recursive (-r) flag:
		rm -r dir_to_remove/
		to remove a directory with content inside of it->rm -rf dir_with_content_to_remove/)
-> mv (to move (or rename) files and directories through your file system
		To use this command, you’d type its name with the source and destination files:
		mv source_file destination_folder/
		mv command_list.txt commands/
		To utilize absolute paths, you’d use:
		mv /home/kinsta/BestMoviesOfAllTime ./ -> where ./ is the directory you’re currently in.
		 to rename files while keeping them in the same directory
		 mv old_file.txt new_named_file.txt)
->mkdir (To create folders in the shell
		Just specify the new folder’s name, ensure it doesn’t exist, and you’re ready to go
			mkdir images/
		To create subdirectories with a simple command, use the parent (-p) flag
			mkdir -p movies/2004/)
-> man (It displays the manual page of any other command (as long as it has one) man man / man mkdir)
-> touch (allows you to update the access and modification times of the specified files
			To change its modification date to the current time, we need to use the -m flag:
			touch -m old_file
			Nonetheless, most of the time, you won’t use touch to modify file dates, 
			but rather to create new empty files: touch new_file_name)
-> chmod ( lets you change the mode of a file (permissions) quickly
			The basic permissions a file can have are:r (read) w (write) x (execute)
			One of the most common use cases for chmod is to make a file executable by the user.
			To do this, type chmod and the flag +x, 
			followed by the file you want to modify permissions on
				chmod +x script)
-> ./  (It lets your shell run an executable file with any interpreter installed 
		in your system directly from the terminal.
			Here’s how we’d convert the script into an executable and run it:
			chmod +x script
			./script )
-> exit (you can end a shell session and, in most cases, automatically close the terminal you’re using)
-> sudo(This command stands for “superuser do,” and it lets you act as a superuser or root user while you’re running a specific command.
		Sudo is commonly used to install software or to edit files outside the user’s home directory:
			sudo apt install gimp
			sudo cd /root/ )
-> shotdown (As you may guess, the shutdown command lets you power off your machine. However, it also can be used to halt and reboot it.
				To power off your computer immediately (the default is one minute), type:
					shutdown now
				You can also schedule to turn off your system in a 24-hour format:
					shutdown 20:40
				To cancel a previous shutdown call, you can use the -c flag:
					shutdown -c)
